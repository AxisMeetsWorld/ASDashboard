# ASDashboard
This is an attempt to build a dashboard for a non-profit. I can only post the code because some of the information in the sheet is private.
I have a bunch of statistics on the various clients of this non-profit and their employee structure. We gathered a count of how each client repsonded to questions about their employee structure. Now, I am trying to create a dashboard based on these different statistics similar to what you would see here: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/controls
